# EnjoyingCooking

This pet project I developed for my own competition. I made WebAPI which has a database with Recipes and Users. All controllers realized very well and are working. 

Were added some Services such as Authorization, Authentication, and DBContext. Also, I made Automation QA tests for User email and password with Regex. I developed tests on XUnit.

The angular part of the project is developed in the other repository: https://github.com/Mrex-cyber/Enjoying-Cooking
